XMEGA128A1U DFU BOOTLOADER
==========================

I've included this in the repository to make it easy to find and install. This
is simply the standard AVR1916 bootloader. It can be loaded onto the board with
something like the following (adapt to your AVR programmer):

avrdude -p x128a1u -c atmelice_pdi -P usb -U flash:w:atxmega128a1u_104.hex

Note that it is licensed separately under the Atmel ASF license (NOT a truly
open source license!). Read COPYING for details.
